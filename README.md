# Credit card fraud detection service.

Credit card fraud detection service is a service that has 1 endpoint takes in several parameters as inputs, calls another service to get
information regarding the transaction, and then applies some business logic before returning a decision to approve
or decline the transaction.

## Business Requirements:

The following fraud scenarios need to be implemented
in this proof of concept service that weâ€™re building.
- If the amount of a transaction is over $50,000.00 decline the transaction.
- If the card has been used over 60 times in the last 7 days, decline the transaction.
- If the card has been used under 35 times in the last 7 days, decline the transaction if the (transaction
  amount/times used in last 7 days) > 500. (E.g. Decline if transaction amount is $9000 and the card has
  been used 2 times in the last 7 days. 9000/2 = 4500)
- Approve all other transactions.

## External Service Call:

We have a external microservice that
returns how many times a card has been used in each of 
the past 7 days. This service can be called using the following endpoint:.
